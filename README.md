first thoughts: home page needs form with 4 elements, name of item, description of item, price, and location. (5 if including picture - will come back to that)
created html & css for a basic form with the imputs and relevent ids etc.
created server with express + node
can't figure out how to access form data from seperate html doc / or can't post form data to seperate html doc.
after several hours of painful headaches trying to get this to work to no avail, figured out EJS was neccessary.
Once EJS was imported, it was smooth sailing from there out.
